Celebrations is a Teams app that helps team members celebrate each others’ birthdays, anniversaries, and other recurring events. It remembers special occasions of all the team members and sends a friendly message in all the teams selected at the time of event creation, to make the team members feel special on their day.

The app provides an easy interface for all the team members to personally add and view their events and also allows the user to select the teams in which the events gets shared.
